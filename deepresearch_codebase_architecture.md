# DeepResearch Codebase Management Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the design for integrating GitHub-like codebase management features into the DeepResearch mode of Panther AI. The system will enable multi-agent collaborative development, version control, project management, and deployment capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Repository Management System
```
repositories/
├── projects/           # Project repositories
│   ├── {project_id}/
│   │   ├── .deepresearch/    # DeepResearch metadata
│   │   ├── branches/         # Branch management
│   │   ├── commits/          # Commit history
│   │   ├── issues/           # Issue tracking
│   │   ├── pull_requests/    # PR management
│   │   ├── collaborators/    # Agent collaborators
│   │   └── deployments/      # Deployment history
│   └── shared/               # Shared repositories
```

## Integration with DeepResearch Mode

### 1. Enhanced Multi-Agent System
The existing multi-agent system will be extended with codebase management capabilities:

```python
# Enhanced multi-agent research with codebase management
def enhanced_multi_agent_research(prompt, project_context=None):
    # Initialize agents with codebase management roles
    agents = {
        "architect": ArchitectureAgent(),
        "developer": DeveloperAgent(),
        "reviewer": ReviewerAgent(),
        "tester": TestingAgent(),
        "deployer": DeploymentAgent()
    }

    # Execute collaborative development workflow
    project = create_or_load_project(prompt)
    branch = create_feature_branch(project, prompt)

    # Collaborative development cycle
    while not project.is_complete():
        # Generate code
        code = agents["developer"].generate_code(prompt, project)

        # Review and test
        review = agents["reviewer"].review_code(code)
        tests = agents["tester"].generate_tests(code)

        # Deploy if approved
        if review.approved and tests.passed:
            agents["deployer"].deploy_code(code, project)

        # Commit changes
        commit_changes(branch, code, f"Implemented: {prompt}")

    return project
```

### 2. Project Context Integration
- Projects maintain context across sessions
- Agent memory persists project knowledge
- Collaborative learning from past projects
- Knowledge sharing between agents

### 3. Workflow Automation
- Automated project initialization
- Template-based project creation
- Standardized development workflows
- Quality gate enforcement
